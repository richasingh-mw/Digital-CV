              <p>Hi, I'm Richa! I am an Application Engineer at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a>  in Hyderabad, India. I specialize in empowering both commercial and government customers to forge innovative aerospace and defense solutions. My journey in this domain is fueled by a passion for merging theoretical knowledge with practical applications, particularly in control design and automation for aerospace applications.  </p> 

              <p>I completed my Masters + PhD Dual Degree in Aerospace Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in">(IITB)</a>, with a specialization in Dynamics and controls, in 2015-2022.  My doctoral research focused on the dynamic modeling and nonlinear control of a laboratory mini SR-30 gas turbine engine. This challenging yet rewarding endeavor led me to develop a first-principle-based dynamic model of the engine, which was further enhanced by testing and validating various nonlinear control laws.</p>

                <abstract>
                In recent times, deep learning methods have achieved remarkable performance on various computer vision tasks, thanks to the availability of large, well-curated data sets (e.g. ImageNet, COCO). However, there still exist several application scenarios where either the amount or quality of annotations is limited. This warrants a need for a solution in novel use cases that includes annotating or re-annotating application specific data. Existing tools for annotations present several limitations including operating with high-resolution images, as well as annotating rare application data, such as defects on concrete surfaces. To address these issues, we are working towards developing a method for auto-annotation.

The key factor here is we developed our own data from various laboratory set-ups such as Gas turbine engine, Hybrid-2-tank system, DC Motor and implemented ML/DL algorithm for system identification and fault diagnosis in real-time. I was responsible to develop the entire five-days course curriculum. The program was attended by faculty from premium institute such as NITs and industry like BPCL.

                A first principles based mathematical model of a laboratory SR-30 engine is developed using the state variable method. The aim is to utilize the model to
obtain the shaft speed (RPM) response with fuel flow as input.  
The mathematical model captures both the steady state and transient behavior of the engine.
In addition, the model incorporates actuator dynamics to enable control related studies. A
simulator with a graphical user interface is then developed in the Simulink environment. The
steady state and transient simulation results are validated against experimental data obtained from the laboratory SR-30 engine. The simulation results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental runs.

               The hybrid two tanks (H2T) setup is conceptualized, designed and developed by systems and control engineering group, IIT Bombay. It is developed to provide a common experimental platform for linear models, nonlinear models, SISO and MIMO systems, with or without delays, etc. The setup consists of two acrylic tubular tanks of similar dimensions with height of 60 cm and radius of 15 cm, a reservoir, two pumps, two heaters and a variety of valves and instrumentation in order to allow it to be configured in a variety of ways. Tank 1 and tank 2 are connected to each other by means of valves name as belimo valve, which is used to define the interaction between the two tanks.
